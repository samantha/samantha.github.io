  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Prediction Modeling for Application-Specific Communication Architecture Design of Optical NoC},
  author={Trajkovic, J. and Karimi, S. and Hangsan, S. and Zhang, W.},
  abstract={Multi-core system-on-chip are becoming state-of-the-art and therefore there is a need for fast and energy-efficient interconnect to take full advantage of the computational capabilities. Integration of silicon photonics with traditional electrical interconnect in Network on Chip (NoC) proposes a promising solution for overcoming the scalability issues of electrical interconnect. In this paper, we derive and evaluate prediction modeling techniques for the design space exploration (DSE) of application-specific communication architectures for Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC). Our proposed model accurately predicts network packet latency, contention delay, the static and dynamic energy consumption of the network. This work specifically addresses the challenge of accurately estimating performance metrics of the entire design space without having to perform time-consuming and computationally-intensive exhaustive simulations.},
